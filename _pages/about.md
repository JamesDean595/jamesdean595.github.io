Hello, and welcome to the site! I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics at North Dakota State University, and my focus is macroeconomics and monetary policy. Specifically, my research looks at the changes in monetary policy with the introduction of unconventional policies, like forward guidance and quantitative easing. I also enjoy teaching, with most of my teaching experience in macroeconomics and econometrics. I received my PhD in Economics from West Virginia University in 2022. Before grad school at WVU, I earned my bachelor's degree in economics from Lubbock Christian University, where I also played for the golf team and was part of the Honors College. If you're interested, you can find a copy of my CV [here](/cv/).

<!-- ## Most Recent Paper: Better On Average?

My most recent paper incorporates the term structure and introduces the Fed’s new average inflation targeting (AIT) framework into a DSGE model with an occasionally binding zero-lower bound. When agents know how the Fed conducts this averaging, AIT improves the stability of inflation and household utility compared to standard inflation targeting. Inflation is most stable, and household utility is highest, when the Fed targets average inflation over 8 and 16 quarters, respectively. However, the Fed has not revealed how many lags they plan to incorporate into their average, and this imperfect information affects the model’s results. If agents don’t know the details of the policy, inflation is most stable when the Fed averages inflation over longer periods. However, outcomes are always better when the Fed reveals the specific details about the policy. You can download my paper [here](/files/Better_On_Average.pdf). -->
