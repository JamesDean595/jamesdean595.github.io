Hello, and welcome to the site! I'm currently a 5th-year PhD candidate at West Virginia University, and my focus is macroeconomics and monetary policy. Specifically, my research looks at the changes in monetary policy with the introduction of unconventional policies, like forward guidance and quantitative easing. I also enjoy teaching, with most of my teaching experience focused on macroeconomics as well. Before grad school at WVU, I earned my bachelor's degree in economics from Lubbock Christian University, where I also played for the golf team. I'm on the job market in the 2021-2022 academic year, and I'll be at the Southerns and AEA meetings. If you're interested, you can find a copy of my CV [here](/cv/).

## Job Market Paper: There's No Fighting FAIT

My job market paper considers whether flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT) improves monetary policy when the zero-lower bound is frequently binding and we have to utilize unconventional monetary policies. In essence, interest rates have fallen in the industrialized world, so interest rate policy is more frequently constrained by the lower bound. Thus, the Fed more frequently must turn to unconventional tools like quantitative easing to set policy. To examine whether average inflation targeting actually improves policy when we consider these limitations, I augment a DSGE model with unconventional policy to incorporate AIT. Overall, AIT responds more slowly to shocks, leading to larger changes in output and inflation. However, simulations show that AIT better stabilizes inflation and output over time and decreases the incidence of the zero-lower bound, and that it's best for the central bank to target average inflation over roughly 1.5 years.
