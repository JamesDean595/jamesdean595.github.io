Hello, and welcome to the site! I'm currently a 5th-year PhD candidate at West Virginia University, and my focus is macroeconomics and monetary policy. Specifically, my research looks at the changes in monetary policy with the introduction of unconventional policies, like forward guidance and quantitative easing. I also enjoy teaching, with most of my teaching experience focused on macroeconomics as well. Before grad school at WVU, I earned my bachelor's degree in economics from Lubbock Christian University, where I also played for the golf team. I'm on the job market in the 2021-2022 academic year, and I'll be at the Southerns and (virtual) AEA meetings. If you're interested, you can find a copy of my CV [here](/cv/).

## Job Market Paper: Better On Average?

My job market paper incorporates the term structure and introduce the Fed’s new average inflation targeting (AIT) framework into a DSGE model with an occasionally binding zero-lower bound. When agents know how the Fed conducts this averaging, AIT improves the stability of inflation and household utility compared to standard inflation targeting. Inflation is most stable, and household utility is highest, when the Fed targets average inflation over 8 and 16 quarters, respectively. However, the Fed has not revealed how many lags they plan to incorporate into their average, and this imperfect information affects the model’s results. If agents don’t know the details of the policy, inflation is most stable when the Fed averages inflation over longer periods. However, outcomes are always better when the Fed reveals the specific details about the policy. You can download my paper [here](/Better_On_Average_JMP/).
